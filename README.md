===================

Longest Common Subsequence implementation in C using O(M+N) space and O(M*N) time  
Takes input from standard in and prints the solution to standard out.  
Input should be this format:  
N M  
A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 ... AN  
B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 ... BM  
First line contains two space separated integers, n and m, where n is the size of sequence A, while m is size of sequence B. In next line there are n space separated integers representing sequence A, and in third line there are m space separated integers representing sequence B. N and M are (your C compiler may vary) 32-bit integers (in C: int). The integers A1 to AN and B1 to BM are capable of being 64-bit integers (again, YCCMV; long long int). All of these integers are positive. I have not tested for negative integers.   
Output is simply one of the longest common subsequences.
