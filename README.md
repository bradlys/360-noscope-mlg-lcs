===================

Longest Common Subsequence implementation in C using O(M+N) space  
Takes input from standard in and prints the solution to standard out.  
Input should be this format:  
N M  
A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 ... AN  
B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 ... BM  
First line contains two space separated integers, n and m, where n is the size of sequence A, while m is size of sequence B. In next line there are n space separated integers representing sequence A, and in third line there are m space separated integers representing sequence B.  
Output is simply one of the longest common subsequences.
